# 🏡 House Price Prediction Dashboard

This project predicts housing prices using the Boston Housing dataset. It includes a complete data cleaning pipeline, a regression model built with scikit-learn, and an interactive dashboard using Streamlit. Users can explore price trends, feature correlations, and model insights through dynamic charts and filters. 

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts housing prices using the `house.csv` dataset. It includes a complete data cleaning pipeline, a regression model built with scikit-learn, and an interactive dashboard built using Streamlit. Users can explore price trends, feature correlations, and model insights through dynamic charts and filters. The project was developed as part of the CodeVeda internship to demonstrate practical skills in data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning deployment.

## 🚀 Features
- 📊 Interactive dashboard with filters for rooms, age, and river proximity
- 📈 Regression model using `LinearRegression` from `scikit-learn`
- 🔥 Feature importance visualization
